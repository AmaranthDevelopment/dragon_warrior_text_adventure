# Dragon Warrior Text Adventure

While putting my Nintendo Power issues in magazine bags, I was flipping through the March/April 1990 issue and noticed that a choose your own adventure game was added to the end of the Dragon Warrior coverage. I thought it would be a neat idea to create a Web based version of it for posterity. The text is typed verbatim from the magazine, typos and all. Please don't email me or open an issue due to typos or grammatical errors.
